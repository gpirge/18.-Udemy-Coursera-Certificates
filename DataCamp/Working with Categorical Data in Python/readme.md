Course Description

Being able to understand, use, and summarize non-numerical data—such as a person’s blood type or marital status—is a vital component of being a data scientist. In this course, you’ll learn how to manipulate and visualize categorical data using pandas and seaborn. Through hands-on exercises, you’ll get to grips with pandas' categorical data type, including how to create, delete, and update categorical columns. You’ll also work with a wide range of datasets including the characteristics of adoptable dogs, Las Vegas trip reviews, and census data to develop your skills at working with categorical data.
