Course Description

In 2019, the average salary for data engineers overtook data scientists. How did this happen? Companies wanting to find the gold within their data realized it wasn’t possible if they hadn’t yet built the mine. Data engineers lay the foundations that make data science possible.

In this course, you’ll learn about a data engineer’s core responsibilities, how they differ from data scientists, and facilitate the flow of data through an organization. Through hands-on exercises you’ll follow Spotflix, a fictional music streaming company, to understand how their data engineers collect, clean, and catalog their data. By the end of the course, you’ll understand what your company's data engineers do, be ready to have a conversation with a data engineer, and have a solid foundation to start your own data engineer journey.
