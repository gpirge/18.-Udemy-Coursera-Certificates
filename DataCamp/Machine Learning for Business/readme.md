This course will introduce the key elements of machine learning to the business leaders. We will focus on the key insights and base practices how to structure business questions as modeling projects with the machine learning teams. You will understand the different types of models, what kind of business questions they help answer, or what kind of opportunities they can uncover, also learn to identify situations where machine learning should NOT be applied, which is equally important. You will understand the difference between inference and prediction, predicting probability and amounts, and how using unsupervised learning can help build meaningful customer segmentation strategy.
